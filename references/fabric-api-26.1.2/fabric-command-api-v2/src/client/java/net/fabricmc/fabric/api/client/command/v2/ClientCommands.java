/**
 * Manages client-sided commands and provides some related helper methods.
 *
 * <p>Client-sided commands are fully executed on the client,
 * so players can use them in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
 *
 * <p>Registrations can be done in handlers for {@link ClientCommandRegistrationCallback#EVENT}
 * (See example below.)
 *
 * <p>The commands are run on the client game thread by default.
 * Avoid doing any heavy calculations here as that can freeze the game's rendering.
 * For example, you can move heavy code to another thread.
 *
 * <p>This class also has alternatives to the server-side helper methods in
 * {@link net.minecraft.commands.Commands}:
 * {@link #literal(String)} and {@link #argument(String, ArgumentType)}.
 *
 * <p>The precedence rules of client-sided and server-sided commands with the same name
 * are an implementation detail that is not guaranteed to remain the same in future versions.
 * The aim is to make commands from the server take precedence over client-sided commands
 * in a future version of this API.
 *
 * <h2>Example command</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ClientCommandRegistrationCallback.EVENT.register((dispatcher, buildContext) -> {
 * 		dispatcher.register(
 * 			ClientCommands.literal("hello").executes(context -> {
 * 				context.getSource().sendFeedback(Component.literal("Hello, world!"));
 * 				return 0;
 * 			})

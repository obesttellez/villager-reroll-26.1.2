 * This is a mixin to the Registry.PendingTagLoad implementation in MappedRegistry.
 * It applies pending tag aliases to static registries when data packs are loaded
 * and to dynamic registries when data packs are reloaded using the {@code /reload} command.
 * (Tags run on their own data loading system separate from resource reloaders, so we need to inject them
 * once the tag and resource reloads are done, which is here.)

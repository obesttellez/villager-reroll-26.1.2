/**
 * Contains interfaces for the events that can be used to modify models at different points in the loading and baking
 * process.
 *
 * <p>Example use cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Overriding the model for a particular block state - check if the given block state matches the desired block
 *     state. If so, return your desired model, otherwise return the given model.</li>
 *     <li>Wrapping a model to override certain behaviors - simply return a new model instance and delegate calls
 *     to the original model as needed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Phases are used to ensure that modifications occur in a reasonable order, e.g. wrapping occurs after overrides,
 * and separate phases are provided for mods that wrap their own models and mods that need to wrap models of other mods
 * or wrap models arbitrarily.
 *
 * <p>Any event may be invoked concurrently with other invocations of the same event or other events, subject to
 * reasonable constraints. For example, a block/item model and its dependencies must be loaded before the block/item
 * model is baked.
 *
 * <p>These callbacks are invoked for <b>every single model that is loaded or baked</b>, so implementations should be
 * as efficient as possible.
